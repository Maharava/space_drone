### **I. Core Components**

#### **1. Conversation Nodes**
- Each dialogue point is a "node."
- Nodes contain:
  - **NPC Dialogue**: Text displayed to the player, as no audio is used.
  - **Player Options**: Multiple text-based responses for the player to choose from.
  - **Triggers**: Consequences or effects tied to specific responses, such as setting flags, granting items, or starting events.
- Nodes are connected via branches, dictating the flow of the conversation based on choices and conditions.

#### **2. Flags**
- Flags act as variables that track player choices, actions, and quest progress.
- Examples:
  - **Boolean Flags**: Simple True/False values (e.g., `QuestAccepted = True`).
  - **Counters**: Numeric values for tracking progress (e.g., `OreCollected = 5`).
  - **Status Flags**: Strings or enums for more complex tracking (e.g., `FactionStanding = Neutral`).

#### **3. Conditions**
- Conditions control the availability of player responses or NPC dialogue, based on the state of the flags.
- Outcomes:
  - **Visible**: Response is shown and selectable if the condition is met.
  - **Hidden**: Response is not displayed to the player if the condition is unmet.
  - **Inactive**: Response is visible but grayed out and unselectable if the condition is unmet.

#### **4. Triggers**
- Triggers are actions executed upon selecting a response, such as:
  - **Flag Changes**: Update flags (e.g., `QuestCompleted = True`).
  - **Item Transactions**: Add or remove items from the player's inventory.
  - **Event Activation**: Start or modify events (e.g., ambushes, sector changes).
  - **Quest Updates**: Progress or complete quests.
  - **Branch Redirection**: Move the conversation to another node or end it.

### **II. System Flow**

1. **Initialization**:
   - When interacting with an NPC, the conversation tree is loaded.
   - All conditions for dialogue options are evaluated based on current flag states.

2. **Player Interaction**:
   - The player selects a response from the visible options.
   - The selected response triggers predefined actions:
     - Flags are updated, items are awarded or removed, and events are initiated.

3. **Branching**:
   - The conversation tree branches based on the player's choice, leading to the next node or ending the dialogue.

4. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - Subsequent interactions with the NPC or related characters reflect changes in flags, unlocking or altering dialogue options.

### **III. Implementation in Python**

#### **1. Structuring the Conversation Tree**
- Represent the conversation tree as a dictionary or JSON file for easy management:
  ```json
  {
      "root": {
          "npc_text": "Hello, traveler! Are you interested in earning some ore?",
          "options": [
              {"text": "Tell me more.", "next_node": "details", "triggers": {"MiningQuestOffered": true}},
              {"text": "Not interested.", "next_node": "end", "triggers": {}}
          ]
      },
      "details": {
          "npc_text": "Great! Here's what I need you to do...",
          "options": [
              {"text": "I'll do it.", "next_node": "end", "triggers": {"MiningQuestAccepted": true, "AddItem": "OreDrill"}},
              {"text": "On second thought, no thanks.", "next_node": "end", "triggers": {"MiningQuestOffered": false}}
          ]
      }
  }
  ```
- Store the conversation tree in external files (e.g., JSON) for easier updates without modifying code.

#### **2. Managing Flags**
- Use a Python dictionary to store and manage flags globally:
  ```python
  flags = {
      "MiningQuestOffered": False,
      "MiningQuestAccepted": False,
      "OreCollected": 0
  }
  ```
- Update flags dynamically during gameplay using trigger functions.

#### **3. Evaluating Conditions**
- Implement a function to evaluate conditions before displaying dialogue options:
  ```python
  def evaluate_condition(flag_conditions):
      for flag, value in flag_conditions.items():
          if flags.get(flag) != value:
              return False
      return True
  ```

#### **4. Processing Triggers**
- Define a trigger processing function to handle actions tied to player responses:
  ```python
  def process_triggers(triggers):
      for key, value in triggers.items():
          if key == "AddItem":
              add_item_to_inventory(value)
          else:
              flags[key] = value
  ```

#### **5. Dynamic Updates**
- Ensure NPC interactions check and refresh conditions and triggers during each interaction.

### **IV. Design Considerations**

1. **Replayability**:
   - Include hidden or unlockable dialogue options tied to rare flags for added depth.

2. **Modular Design**:
   - Ensure each conversation tree and flag system is independent to allow easy addition or modification.

3. **Testing**:
   - Test thoroughly for flag-related bugs (e.g., conditions that incorrectly block or enable options).

4. **Player Feedback**:
   - Provide subtle visual indicators for disabled options to communicate unmet conditions.

### **V. Example Workflow**

#### **Scenario: NPC Offers a Mining Quest**
1. **Root Node**:
   - NPC: "Hello, traveler! Are you interested in earning some ore?"
   - Player Options:
     - "Tell me more." (Sets `MiningQuestOffered = True`)
     - "Not interested." (Ends conversation)

2. **Child Node**:
   - Condition: `MiningQuestOffered = True`
   - NPC: "Great! Here's what I need you to do..."
   - Player Options:
     - "I'll do it." (Sets `MiningQuestAccepted = True`, adds `OreDrill` to inventory)
     - "On second thought, no thanks." (Resets `MiningQuestOffered = False`)

3. **Follow-up Interaction**:
   - NPC: "Have you completed the mining task?"
   - Responses depend on the flag `MiningQuestAccepted` and item presence.
