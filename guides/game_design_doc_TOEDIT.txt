## **1. Drone Classification and Evolution**

### **A. Drone Categories**

1. **Common Drones (Regular Drones)**
   - **Purpose:**  
     - Serve as basic, easily built units fulfilling core automated tasks such as combat, mining, and repair.
   - **Functionality:**  
     - Provide straightforward benefits with flat upgrade paths (e.g., improved armor, faster processing).
     - Occasionally issue basic, robotic text-based remarks to add minimal personality.
   - **Evolution Potential:**  
     - Select common drones—when provided with the right upgrades—may evolve into rare drones. Many common drones remain utilitarian, while a few become stepping stones toward rare types.

2. **Rare Drones**
   - **Purpose:**  
     - Offer enhanced versatility and specialized roles beyond the common units.
   - **Characteristics:**  
     - Feature randomized secondary stats on acquisition for variability.
     - Include basic interactions—short, preset text lines and status updates that hint at developing AI.
   - **Evolution Potential:**  
     - Some rare drones have upgrade pathways that can lead to unique drones. Transitioning from rare to unique will be challenging and require advanced resources.
   - **Upgrades:**  
     - Provide both standard upgrades and a “greater improvement” option, which secretly carries the potential for evolution during the upgrade process.

3. **Unique Drones**
   - **Purpose:**  
     - Represent the elite tier of drones with distinct, in-lore AI personalities and specialized non-combat functions.
   - **Characteristics:**  
     - Offer powerful synergy abilities and contribute to quests or in-game events.
     - Possess scripted dialogue (triggered via interactive dialogue trees) that can advise the player or provide status updates.
     - Their artificial tone remains evident at all times, ensuring that players feel comfortable replacing or upgrading them.
   - **Acquisition:**  
     - Unique drones are never obtained directly through the gacha system; they must be either found in-game or achieved by evolving rare drones.

### **B. Drone Evolution and Upgrades**

- **Upgrade Pathways:**  
  - Every drone starts with basic upgrade options to enhance standard stats.  
  - A “greater improvement” upgrade exists on top of regular enhancements. For the special drones, choosing this option might trigger an evolution. It always gives a notable benefit to the drone type (eg, a mining drone gets a big boost to mining):
    - **Common → Rare:** Some common drones, once upgraded multiple times, unlock the possibility of evolving into a rare unit.
    - **Rare → Unique:** Only a handful of rare drones have the potential to further evolve into unique drones.
  - **Player Input & Resource Requirements:**  
    - Players see a clear choice between incremental improvements and a “greater improvement” option (with no prior hint that evolution will occur).  
    - Advanced evolutions demand special resources: refined rare metals, materials available only at certain stations (or when a faction’s approval is high), and sometimes exclusive items dropped from deep-space enemies.
  - **Quest Integration:**  
    - Quests and exploration directly furnish advanced resources—or guide players on how to acquire them—ensuring that evolving a drone is within reach despite its cost.

## **2. Gacha Acquisition and Duplicate Drone Handling**

### **A. Gacha Mechanic for Drone Acquisition**

- **Mechanism Overview:**  
  - Drone acquisition via gacha is color-coded by rarity:
    - **30% chance for a failure (returning some materials)**
    - **50% chance for Common Drones**
    - **20% chance for Rare Drones**
  - Unique drones are never available directly from gacha; they are achievable only through in-game evolution or discovery.
- **Player Experience:**  
  - The gacha process remains straightforward and free of heavy narrative elements while still introducing enough random chance to encourage continued engagement.

### **B. Handling Duplicate Drones**

- **Salvage System:**  
  - Players have a dedicated “salvage” interface that they can initiate to break down duplicate drones.
  - **Outcomes of Salvaging:**  
    - Mostly, players recoup the original resource investment.  
    - There is a modest chance—especially with duplicates of rare drones—to receive rare upgrade materials.
- **Resource Integration:**  
  - Salvaged duplicates contribute to the overall evolution and upgrade systems by providing valuable components that feed into crafting and refinement of advanced drones.

## **3. Drone Abilities: Synergy, Non-Combat, and AI Interactions**

### **A. Abilities and Passive Triggers**

- **Core and Situational Functions:**  
  - Drones are designed to offer a variety of benefits:
    - **Combat Roles:** Automated attack, defense, and repair routines.
    - **Non-Combat Functions:** Some units might automatically mine, scan, explore, or boost the players shields, speed, agility, etc.
  - **Passive Activation:**  
    - Abilities trigger automatically based on in-game conditions.  
    - Notifications (via text logs or mini-reports) alert players when a drone’s special ability has activated.
  - **Randomized Secondary Stats:**  
    - All drones come with slightly randomized secondary stats to encourage collection diversity and long-term strategic planning.
    - Unique drones have a method of re-rolling this, while other drones do not.

### **B. Artificial Dialogue and Interaction**

- **Rare Drones:**  
  - Offer basic status messages and brief interaction lines within the drone hub screen.
- **Unique Drones:**  
  - Feature more robust dialogue via a dialogue tree system.  
  - They might engage in conversations during key events or provide advice or commentary when a quest condition is met.
  - Their interactions underline their advanced AI nature while maintaining an unmistakably mechanical tone.

## **4. Tactical Deployment and Carrier Integration**

### **A. Drone Loadout and Deployment**

- **Loadout Management:**  
  - Players choose which drones from their hangar are in their loadout, and may launch accordingly.
- **Automated Operation:**  
  - Once launched, drones are automated until recalled.
- **Performance Reporting:**  
  - Text-based reports and logs provide detailed feedback on drone performance and any triggered abilities, helping players continually refine their fleet composition.

### **B. Integration with Other Game Systems**

- **Refining and Crafting:**  
  - The production of advanced resources via mining and refining directly supports drone evolution.
- **Space Stations and NPCs:**  
  - Stations serve as hubs for trading, upgrading, and refining resources. They also provide context within which players can earn the materials necessary for drone enhancements.
