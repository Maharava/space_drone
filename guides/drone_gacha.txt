# **Drone System Design Document**

This document outlines the design and evolution of the drone system in our game. Drones are not only automated units but also represent a collection that ranges from common, utilitarian workhorses to rare, unique units with distinctive in-lore AI hints. These drones play roles both in combat and in utility, and their evolution and resource management contribute significantly to gameplay depth.

## **1. Drone Categories**

### **Common Drones (Regular Drones)**
- **Purpose:**  
  - Serve as basic, easily built units that perform core tasks (combat, mining, repair, etc.) without added personality.
  - Act as reliable workhorses for day-to-day operations.
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Straightforward functionality with flat upgrade paths (e.g., better armor or improved efficiency).
  - Some common drones may have the potential to evolve into rare drones through upgrade pathways.
  - Lack any substantial AI dialogue or personality.

### **Rare Drones**
- **Purpose:**  
  - Provide enhanced utility and tactical variation beyond the common units.
  - Offer some level of interactive feedback (basic interactions, alerts, or simple remarks) without a full dialogue tree.
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Possess specialized or situational abilities along with randomized secondary stats to encourage experimentation.
  - Some rare drones can evolve from common drones and, in turn, may evolve into unique drones.
  - Basic interactions might include limited messaging in the drone hub (e.g., brief greetings or status updates) that hint at a developing personality.

### **Unique Drones**
- **Purpose:**  
  - Represent the prized units in the collection with distinct artificial personalities.
  - Contribute unique abilities that impact quests, events, and other gameplay systems.
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Have richer, in-lore AI with scripted personality snippets and specialized non-combat functions.
  - Their evolution is supported by external resources rather than being locked behind narrative moments. Quests and exploration can provide the necessary resources or directions for evolving these drones.
  - Unique drones secondary stats can be re-rolled, reflecting their status as being unique. Once unlocked, the player may never again get the same unique drone, even if they disassemble it – they are unique

## **2. Acquisition and the Gacha Mechanic**

### **Gacha Mechanic Overview**
- **Approach:**  
  - The gacha system is the primary way of acquiring new drones through resource inputs.
  - It randomly yields drones from the spectrum of common, rare, or unique, based on the system’s design probabilities.
- **Design Guideline:**  
  - Keep the process straightforward, avoiding an overt narrative-driven reveal.
  - Focus on strategic balance and long-term collection value rather than big cinematic moments.

### **Handling Duplicates**
- **Refinement and Salvage:**  
  - Duplicate drones can be refined or disassembled for component resources. This process yields materials required for upgrades or future gacha pulls.
  - When refining a duplicate, there will be a chance to receive rare upgrade materials—particularly valuable when the duplicate is of a higher rarity.
- **Enhanced Returns for Rare Duplicates:**  
  - Rare duplicates offer a greater chance of producing additional or rarer upgrade materials, making them valuable even if the player already owns that drone.
- **Utility:**  
  - Duplicates, rather than just being an inventory nuisance, serve as a resource input—contributing to a more robust and interconnected upgrade system.

## **3. Drone Upgrades and Evolution**

### **Basic Upgrades (Flat Upgrades)**
- **Universal Application:**  
  - All drones, regardless of rarity, can receive straightforward enhancements such as improved armor, faster operation, or better efficiency.
  - These upgrades are designed to maintain the viability of every drone in everyday operations.

### **Advanced Upgrades (Drone Evolution)**
- **Evolution Pathways:**  
  - Some common drones have the potential to evolve into rare drones, and some rare drones can further evolve into unique drones.
- **Mechanics of Evolution:**  
  - Advanced evolutions will not be gated by narrative moments; instead, quests and in-game activities provide resources or direct players toward the methods needed for evolution.
  - For unique drones, evolution might require rare inputs such as alien artifacts, prototype technology, or specific resource combinations.
  - The evolution process not only enhances performance with new abilities or strategic synergies but also deepens the drone's artificial personality—reflected in subtle text interactions within the hub.

## **4. Drone Abilities and Artificial Personality**

### **Non-Combat, Situational, and Synergy Abilities**
- **Core Concept:**  
  - Drones can offer specialized functions that influence encounters beyond raw combat stats.  
  - Some may boost resource collection efficiency, provide situational defense buffs, or trigger synergy bonuses with other systems.
- **Randomized Secondary Stats:**  
  - On acquisition, some rare and unique drones may feature randomized secondary stats. This introduces variability that rewards continued collection and experimentation.
- **Synergy with Carrier Systems:**  
  - Certain drones may unlock additional tactical benefits when used alongside specific carrier functions or in combination with other units.

### **Artificial Dialogue and Interactions**
- **Rare Drones:**  
  - Include basic interactions in the drone hub—simple messages that hint at a developing AI without complex dialogue trees.
- **Unique Drones:**  
  - Feature scripted lines to reinforce their distinct character, but maintain an artificial tone that reminds players these units are ultimately machines.
- **In-Game Hub:**  
  - The carrier’s drone hub displays each unit’s status, backstory, and any triggered interactions or evolution cues.
- **Resource and Quest Integration:**  
  - Quests and exploration opportunities will provide or highlight the resources required for evolving unique drones, ensuring players do not miss these pathways.

## **5. Summary and Design Goals**

- **Diverse Collection:**  
  - Establish a meaningful spectrum of drones—from common workhorses to rare and unique units with specialized abilities and an artificial personality.
- **Robust Upgrade Pathways:**  
  - Ensure that every drone can be upgraded. Basic upgrades improve overall utility, while evolution mechanisms add strategic depth and unique abilities for higher rarity drones.
- **Duplicate Utility:**  
  - Implement a system where duplicate drone pulls are not wasteful but serve as components for further advancement and valuable resource acquisition.
- **Mechanics-Driven Evolution:**  
  - Integrate quest rewards and resource gathering into the evolution process, providing clear, accessible methods for players to enhance their drones without locking progress behind narrative choices.
- **Artificial yet Impactful Dialogue:**  
  - Equip unique drones with artificial, scripted interactions—enough to give character without creating barriers to replacement or upgrades.
